        <p>I've been a typesetter and book designer for almost all of my career, but I can see the writing on the wall: AI is going to put me out of business before I'm ready to retire. &ldquo;Time to retrain,&rdquo; I&nbsp;told myself more than a year ago, but to do what?</p>
        <p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about my work now, and I&nbsp;realize that while I like almost all parts of my job (maybe not the billing and accounting), preparing text for publication and writing VBA macros to help with that process gives me the most joy.</p>
        <p>I started dabbling in webpage development back when layouts were all table-based. It seemed so primitive and tedious, and I gave up on it almost before I got started. A lot has changed since then; the processes of laying out digital pages and laying out print pages has converged. Good typography is much more feasable on the web now. Digital pages can be grid-based&mdash;an approach to layouts that print designers have been using since newspapers were invented. But some things haven&rsquo;t changed; most websites have a lot of text that needs to be prepared, and coding is still an integral part of that preparation.</p>
        <p>I already have the skills to present attractive, accessible text. My degrees in English equipped me to copyedit and proofread text. I've retained a lot of the knowledge about HTML and CSS that I picked up from my earlier dabbling in digital publishing. It's plain to me now that the next logical step in my growth as a designer and typesetter is to develop my expertise in the production of websites and ePUBs. And now, nearly at the end of a six-month, full-stack tech bootcamp, I'm learning the latest digital publishing tools and techniques and looking forward to a challenging but fun new world.</p>
