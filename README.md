## Description 
My portfolio uses React to build a web page that provides users with a short biography about me, a contact form to reach out to me, a list of my proficiencies and a link to download my resume, and, most importantly, links to the live pages and Github repos for six projects I've completed during my full-stack bootcamp. The site includes four components—header, nav (contained in the header), footer, and root—and five pages—about, projects, resume, contact, and a generic error page. The design is deliberately minimal and clean, but the design is responsive.

You can see a screen shot of the about page below.

## Installation
As a live site hosted on Render, no installation is necessary. If, however, you want to run the page locally download this repo being careful not to change the file and folder structure as shown in the image below.

From the root folder, execute these commands:
  
  npm install [installs dependences]
  npm run start

A browser should open to the About page.

## Usage
At the top of the page, you will see my name, my email address, and the navigation bar. Links are highlighted with an orange glow when the cursor hovers over them, and the page on display is similarly highlighted in the menu bar. On the projects page, you will see six cards with details about projects I've completed varying from simple to complex. Each card includes the title of the project, a link to the Github repo, a link to the live page, and a screen shot from the app. The resume page offers a button to download my resume in PDF format and a list of languages, tools, and technologies for which I have been developing my skills. The contact page presents a form requesting the user's name and email address and soliciting a message to send to me. All fields are required, and when a field loses focus, the user is reminded to complete it. The form is currently nonfunctional, but the email link at the top of the page is active.

## Acknowledgments
This code relied heavily on project code used in a mini-project activity that the class worked on together and on ChatGPT for code checking and clarification.
